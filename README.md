### Project Brief:

We aim to build a dog breed classification syste using Artificial Intelligence (Transfer Learning).

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately identifies the breed of a dog from an image. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) will be employed due to their effectiveness in image classification tasks. The dataset, comprising over 20,000 images of dogs from 120 distinct breeds, will be utilized. The model's performance will be evaluated using a test set of images, with an anticipated accuracy of over 90%. This project has the potential to impact animal shelters, pet owners, and researchers, and mitigation strategies have been identified to address potential risks. With this method, breed identification tasks can be completed with high performance and a reduced requirement for vast quantities of labeled data and computing power.
